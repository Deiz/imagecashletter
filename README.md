## Usage

### Docker

We publish a [public Docker image `moov/imagecashletter`](https://hub.docker.com/r/moov/imagecashletter/) from Docker Hub or use this repository. No configuration is required to serve on `:8083` and metrics at `:9093/metrics` in Prometheus format. We also have docker images for [OpenShift](https://quay.io/repository/moov/imagecashletter?tab=tags).

Start the Docker image:
```
docker run -p 8083:8083 -p 9093:9093 moov/imagecashletter:latest
```

List files stored in-memory
```
curl localhost:8083/files
```
```
{"files":[],"error":null}
```

Create a file on the HTTP server
```
curl -XPOST --data-binary "@./test/testdata/BNK20180905121042882-A.icl" http://localhost:8083/files/create
```
```
{"id":"71ae3f5bc5527cdb1efc88e1814333fd9d6d2edb","fileHeader":{"id":"","standardLevel":"35","testIndicator":"T","immediateDestination":"231380104","immediateOrigin":"121042882", ...
```

Create a file with the JSON format on the HTTP server
```
curl -XPOST -H "content-type: application/json" localhost:8083/files/create --data @./test/testdata/icl-valid.json
```
```
{"id":"8afcde4fc2cf4023e92a7a96be9dbbe44e1e9508","fileHeader":{"id":"","standardLevel":"35","testIndicator":"T","immediateDestination":"231380104","immediateOrigin":"121042882", ...
